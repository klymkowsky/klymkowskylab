      <p><strong>Disciplinary curricula</strong>: The curricular design initiative offered here is based on the presumption that disciplinary departments should have a relatively easy time deciding on the set of required courses their students need to take based on what they can be expected to learn from those courses.</p></td>

Over-ambitious or unmet expectations should be addressed through changes to such required courses both in terms of the content delivered and the pedagogical practices employed.</p>
      <p>The goal of such an (ongoing) curriculum design and evaluation process would be to identify those courses that do not facilitate (and may actually obstruct) students&rsquo; engagement with, and mastery of, their discipline. The process would also serve to identify and address omissions in current curricula and insure, to the extent possible, that the courses a student must take represent a well thought out and effective instructional sequence. Departments, rather than individual instructors, could (and should) be held accountable for the efficacy of their core (required) curricula.</p>
      <p>College core curricula: Designing an effective college core curriculum is a much more difficult task since the consensus as to what an educated person needs to know in terms of history, literature, philosophy, economics, science, etc., can be contentious, particularly when we consider these content areas in a global context.</p>
      <p>That said, we need to take care that core requirements actually achieve their presumptive goals through various forms of cost-benefit analysis.  In the particular area of science for non-science majors, it remains to be established that requiring students to take laboratory courses improves their appreciation for, or understanding of science (its methods and its place in modern society and personal decision making). Certainly, the requirement imposes a burden on students in terms of scheduling, and likely impacts retention and time to degree.<br>
