START is the switch that decides whether a cell will begin to replicate its DNA or not. &nbsp;&nbsp; </p>    <p>As you probably already know (or are coming to suspect), the control of the cell cycle is complex - in an organism as &ldquo;simple&rdquo; as baker&rsquo;s yeast there over 800 proteins involved in the regulatory network controlling the cell cycle (see <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/101/14/4781.full" target="_blank">Li et al., 2004</a> if you dare!)</p>    <p>The START decision is a particularly important one, since once DNA replication begins it is hard to stop without causing mutations (perhaps you can imagine why).&nbsp;</p>    <p>While the regulatory network controlling START is complex, it boils down to whether a particular enzyme, a cyclin-dependent kinase or CDK, in this specific case the CDK2 protein, is active.&nbsp; </p>    <p>A kinase is a protein that catalyzes the phosphorylation of a target protein  [<a href="http://www0.nih.go.jp/mirror/Kinases/pkr/3D/xray/cyclin/htmlmaincdk2.htm" target="_blank">link</a>]; phosphorylation leads to changes in the target proteins' activity. </p></td>    <td>&nbsp;</td>    <td><a href="http://www.d.umn.edu/~pschoff/documents/cyclinCDKrev.pdf" target="_blank"><img src="1342953530.Cb.1.jpg" width="331" height="600" alt="cell cycle start network"></a></td>  </tr></table><table width="720" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">  <tr>    <td><p><img src="1342953530.Cb.2.jpg" width="340" height="330" alt="cyclin-cdk-target"></p></td>    <td>&nbsp;</td>    <td><p>However, CDK2 is inactive unless bound to an polypeptide, a cyclin.&nbsp; While CDKs are normally stable proteins that are made continuously, the expression and stability of cyclins are more actively regulated.&nbsp;</p>    <p>So, from a simplistic but useful perspective, the entire point of the regulatory network controlling START is to control&nbsp;the intracellular concentration of the cyclin(s) that regulates CDK2 activity. </p>    <p>Once CDK2 activity rises  above a certain point, the cell passes through START and begins DNA synthesis. </p>    <p>Once START is passed, the cyclin is actively degraded (which leads to CDK2 inactivation).
