      <p><strong>Disciplinary curricula:</strong> </p>
      <p>The curricular design strategy offered here is based on the presumption that disciplinary departments should have a relatively easy time deciding on what common set of required courses their students should take and what they should learn from those courses. </p></td>

      The addition to current practice is that the performance expectations for students that pass these courses should be explicit and verifiable; that over-ambitious or unmet expectations should be addressed through changes to the required courses, both in terms of the content to be delivered and the pedagogical practices employed. </p>
      <p> The goal of this (ongoing) process is to identify those courses that do not facilitate (and may actually obstruct) students&rsquo; engagement with, and mastery of, their discipline, to identify and address omissions in current curricula, and to insure to the extent possible that at least the required courses a student must take represent a well thought out and effective instructional sequence.  Departments, rather than individual instructors, could (and should) then be held accountable for the efficacy of their core curricula.<sup>1</sup> </p>
      <p>College core curricula. Designing an effective college core curriculum is a much more difficult task since the consensus as to what an educated person needs to know in terms of history, literature, philosophy, economics, etc., can be contentious, particularly when we consider these in a global context. </p>
    <p> That said, we need to take care that core requirements do not hinder disciplinary requirements.  One example, there is now (as I understand it) a college core requirement for a two semester course in natural science with a laboratory component. This has led departments to develop such courses.  But such a requirement siphons off resources available to departments and can actively obstruct the development and deployment of more disciplinarily relevant courses.  As an example, it could well be the case the the introductory laboratory courses in a department like MCDB come at the expense of more intensive and useful (from both a disciplinary and a career perspective) immersive upper division laboratory courses. </p></td>

<p>1 An important note is that low FCQ scores can be seen as evidence for a disregard for the importance of student engagement and effective learning. </p></td>
