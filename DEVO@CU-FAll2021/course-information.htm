    <p><strong>Preferred Student Names and Pronouns</strong>: CU Boulder recognizes that students' legal information doesn't always align with how they identify. Students may update their preferred names and pronouns via the student portal; those preferred names and pronouns are listed on instructors' class rosters. In the absence of such updates, the name that appears on the class roster is the student's legal name.</p>
    <p><strong>Honor Code</strong>: All students enrolled in a University of Colorado Boulder course are responsible for knowing and adhering to&nbsp;the Honor Code.&nbsp;Violations of the policy may include: plagiarism, cheating, fabrication, lying, bribery, threat, unauthorized access to academic materials, clicker fraud, submitting the same or similar work in more than one course without permission from all course instructors involved, and aiding academic dishonesty.
