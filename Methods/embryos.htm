        if you are interested in expanding your colony. To do this you must inject 
        both the male and the female. You should inject the male with 50 U HCG(or 
        50 U PMS) and inject the non-PMS primed female with 750 U HCG. Put them 
        in a 5 gallon bucket together and allow them to remain together overnight. 
        You should do this at the end of the day so the lab will be quiet throughout 
        the night and the frogs are not disturbed. If possible place egg crate 
        at the bottom of the tank to keep the frogs away from the eggs. This will 
        prevent the eggs from being eaten before you separate the couple. The 
        next day, collect the eggs by sucking them up in a pipette and placing 
        them in 10% Holtfreter's solution. We've had the best luck when we dejelly
